* When cloning a whole TFS Project Collection (``$/``) without specifying a local repository name, clone into "tfs-collection" instead of erroring with "Invalid Path". (#1202)
* FindMergeChangesetParent now also takes into account the path of the changes. This should avoid detection of incorrect parent when a changeset has merges in different branches at once.
